.SYNOPSIS
    Delete existing crash dumps so a test captures only the new one.

.DESCRIPTION
    Removes the guest's minidumps and full dump, then confirms both are gone. Run
    this BEFORE triggering a BSOD so the resulting evidence package contains exactly
    the dump from this run (this mirrors the lead's guidance to clear minidumps
    before the test rather than diffing a baseline). Honors the VM's configured
    dump paths (CrashControl DumpFile / MinidumpDir) instead of assuming C:\Windows,
    falling back to the OS defaults.

    Runs on: the GUEST VM. Requires elevation.
