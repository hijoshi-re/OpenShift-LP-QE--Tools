# Development Notes

Key decisions, trade-offs, and lessons learned during development of the
bsod-detector tool. Written for anyone asking "why did you do it this way?"

It also covers **tool-selection rationale** — which tools trigger and capture
BSOD events, and what evidence each vantage point gathers (see
[What the tools gather, by perspective](#what-the-tools-gather-by-perspective)
at the end).

## Why a custom kernel driver instead of NotMyFault?

Microsoft's NotMyFault (from Sysinternals) is the standard tool for triggering
BSODs on demand. We started with it and switched to a custom KeBugCheckEx driver
for three reasons:

1. **NotMyFault's 32-bit binary silently fails on 64-bit Windows.** The download
   includes `notmyfault.exe` (32-bit) and `notmyfaultc64.exe` (64-bit console).
   The 32-bit version prints usage text on a 64-bit OS without any error. This
   cost debugging time before we identified the issue.

2. **`/accepteula` and `/crash` cannot be combined.** NotMyFault's EULA prompt
   blocks execution on first run. Adding `/accepteula` should suppress it, but
   combining `/accepteula /crash N` in a single invocation fails silently
   (the crash type argument is misinterpreted). You must accept the EULA in a
   separate invocation first.

3. **Remote UAC blocks `-Verb RunAs`.** NotMyFault requires elevation. Over SSH,
   `Start-Process notmyfaultc64.exe -Verb RunAs` pops a UAC dialog on the remote
   desktop that never completes in an unattended session. Running directly as
   Administrator over SSH avoids this, but NotMyFault still needs the two-step
   EULA workaround.

The custom `crashme.sys` driver calls `KeBugCheckEx` directly with caller-specified
parameters. No EULA, no UAC prompt, no 32/64 confusion, and we control exactly
which bug-check code and parameters are used.

Operationally, the driver is loaded as a kernel service
(`sc.exe create CrashMe type= kernel`) and fired from user mode with
`crashme-ctl.exe <code> <p1> <p2> <p3> <p4>`; the code-to-parameters mapping
lives in [`../src/data/trigger-methods.json`](../src/data/trigger-methods.json).
Full run steps are in
[`../src/scripts/crash-injector/README.md`](../src/scripts/crash-injector/README.md).

### The tradeoff, stated plainly

Of the three reasons above, only the **32/64-bit** issue is a hard NotMyFault
defect, and even that is avoidable by always using `notmyfaultc64.exe`. The
**EULA** and **UAC** problems are real development annoyances but are solvable
without a custom driver — pre-accept the EULA in the golden snapshot (or set the
registry value directly) and run as local Administrator over SSH (which we
already do) for full elevation.

So the honest, lasting justification for the custom driver is **not** those
annoyances — it is **arbitrary bug-check control**: `crashme.sys` calls
`KeBugCheckEx` with *any* stop code and all four parameters, which is what makes
the 19-code verification sweep (each with exact parameters) possible. NotMyFault
only offers a fixed set of crash types.

That control is not free. The cost is that we **build, test-sign, and maintain a
kernel driver** (cross-compiled with mingw64; see
[Cross-compilation](#cross-compilation-mingw64)), versus NotMyFault's
zero-maintenance, Microsoft-signed binary.

| Consideration | NotMyFault | CrashMe (custom) |
|---|---|---|
| EULA CLI bug (`/accepteula /crash N`) | Workaround: pre-accept in snapshot / registry | N/A |
| 32/64-bit silent failure | Solvable: always use `notmyfaultc64.exe` | N/A (single binary) |
| Arbitrary stop code + 4 parameters | Fixed crash types only | **Full control via `KeBugCheckEx`** |
| Maintenance | Zero (Microsoft-maintained) | Must build, test-sign, and maintain a kernel driver |

**Bottom line:** the custom driver earns its keep *only* through arbitrary
bug-check control. If a future need is satisfied by NotMyFault's fixed crash set,
prefer NotMyFault and drop the driver-maintenance burden.

## Why SSH over WinRM?

Both are available on the test guest. We chose SSH because:

- **Quoting is solved.** PowerShell over SSH with `-EncodedCommand` (base64 UTF-16LE)
  eliminates all quoting issues. WinRM's SOAP XML encoding corrupts certain
  characters and has payload size limits.
- **Connection lifecycle is predictable.** When the guest crashes, the SSH connection
  drops cleanly (TCP RST or timeout). WinRM sessions can hang indefinitely on a
  half-open connection after a BSOD.
- **OpenSSH is built into Windows Server 2019+.** No additional agent or firewall
  rules needed beyond enabling the `sshd` service.
- **Key auth works.** The `administrators_authorized_keys` file provides
  password-free access without storing credentials in scripts.

The `guest-ssh.sh` wrapper auto-detects the guest IP from libvirt, handles both
short inline commands (EncodedCommand) and long scripts (scp + invoke), and sets
`ServerAliveInterval` to detect a dead connection within 15 seconds.

## Why Driver Verifier matters

Driver Verifier is a Windows kernel feature that adds runtime checks around driver
operations (pool allocations, IRQL tracking, I/O verification). It is enabled in
our test VM for all drivers.

This changes observed crash behavior: a KeBugCheckEx call with code `0x0A`
(IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL) may be intercepted and reported as `0xD1`
(DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL) because Verifier catches the violation at a
different point in the call stack.

The `src/data/trigger-methods.json` file records codes **as observed** with
Verifier enabled and marks each entry `"verified": true`. If Verifier is disabled,
the observed codes will differ; re-run `src/scripts/crash-injector/sweep-crashme.sh` to re-baseline.

## Snapshot-based testing methodology

The test loop is deliberately simple and stateless:

```
revert to known-good snapshot
  → start VM
    → wait for SSH
      → trigger BSOD (KeBugCheckEx via crashme-ctl.exe)
        → wait for auto-reboot
          → collect evidence (collect-guest.ps1)
            → pull artifacts to host
              → revert (reset for next iteration)
```

Each iteration starts from identical state. This eliminates:
- Accumulated crash artifacts from prior runs
- Registry corruption from repeated crashes
- Driver state drift from Verifier interactions

The `crashme-installed` snapshot includes the CrashMe driver loaded and ready.
The `clean-baseline` snapshot is the same but without the driver (for non-crash
testing).

## Offline dump extraction as fallback

Some crash types leave the VM unbootable (boot loops, stuck at recovery screen).
When SSH is unreachable after a crash:

1. Force-kill the VM (`virsh destroy`)
2. Mount the guest disk offline using libguestfs (containerized in `host-tools/`)
3. Extract `C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP` and `C:\Windows\Minidump\*.dmp`

This recovers the raw dump files but loses event logs, system context, and the
structured report that `collect-guest.ps1` provides. It exists as a last resort
for the cases where the guest never comes back.

## Implicit detection vs. pre-registered codes

The tool detects ANY bug-check code, not just the 19 we trigger in testing.
Detection relies on the WER System/1001 event that Windows always writes after
a BugCheck reboot. The `bugcheck-codes.json` lookup table provides human-readable
names for known codes, but unknown codes still appear in the report with
`bugCheckName: null`.

This means the tool works as a post-mortem detector for product test failures
without needing to predict which codes might appear.

## Cross-compilation (mingw64)

The test driver and control utility are cross-compiled on Linux using mingw64:

```bash
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -o crashme-ctl.exe crashme-ctl.c
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -shared -o crashme.sys crashme.c \
    -nostdlib -lntoskrnl -Wl,--entry,DriverEntry
```

This keeps the build reproducible on the Linux CI host without needing a Windows
build environment. The resulting PE binaries are verified in bats tests
(`test-build.bats`) by checking for the MZ/PE headers.

## JSON-first output contract

Every script produces exactly one JSON object on stdout. Diagnostics go to stderr
(or xtrace via `BASH_XTRACEFD`). This enables:

- Direct consumption by `jq` in pipelines
- Parsing by AI agents without text extraction
- Structured artifact storage in CI systems
- Composability (one script's output feeds another's input)

Scripts that emit JSON redirect xtrace output to `/dev/null` via
`exec {BASH_XTRACEFD}>/dev/null` before `set -x`. This prevents trace lines from
corrupting the JSON stream while keeping the `set -euxo pipefail` convention
intact.

## What the tools gather, by perspective

The detector collects from two vantage points, because a crashed guest may be
frozen or rebooting and cannot always report on itself. (The architectural
guest/host split is in [`architecture.md`](architecture.md); this section is the
"what evidence, from where" reference.)

### From inside the guest (the detector's normal home; runs after reboot)

- Bug-check code + parameters and faulting module, parsed from the minidump /
  `MEMORY.DMP`.
- Crash dump files: `C:\Windows\Minidump\*.dmp` and `%SystemRoot%\MEMORY.DMP`.
- System/Application event log entries bracketing the crash — especially source
  `BugCheck` (Event ID 1001) and `EventLog` (6008, dirty shutdown).
- System context: OS build, uptime, CPU, driver inventory, signature of the
  suspect driver.
- **Prerequisite:** the dump type must be configured *before* a crash
  (registry `CrashControl` -> complete/kernel/automatic/minidump) with an
  adequate page file, or there is nothing to capture. See
  [`../src/data/crash-control.json`](../src/data/crash-control.json).

### From the host / hypervisor (a crashed guest may be frozen or rebooting)

- **External crash detection** — the host observes a guest hang/reset before the
  guest OS itself recovers.
- **Mount the guest qcow2 from the host** (via libguestfs / `host-tools/`) to
  pull `MEMORY.DMP` even when the guest will not boot. Most robust recovery route.
- **Host kernel-log + VM-config signals** (via
  [`../src/scripts/collect-host-signals.sh`](../src/scripts/collect-host-signals.sh))
  — some root causes never appear in the guest dump. For example,
  `HYPERVISOR_ERROR` (0x20001) can be caused by an Intel split-lock `#AC` trap
  during a Hyper-V enlightened TLB-flush hypercall; the only evidence is the host
  kernel log (`x86/split lock detection: #AC ...`) correlated with the guest's
  Hyper-V `tlbflush`/`ipi` enlightenments in the libvirt domain XML. Patterns and
  feature list live in
  [`../src/data/host-signals.json`](../src/data/host-signals.json).

### Deep dump analysis (symbolized)

- Header parsing (`parse-dump-header.sh`) gives the stop code + parameters
  without a debugger. Bucket / faulting-image attribution requires symbols.
- `analyze-dump.ps1` wraps `cdb !analyze -v` to produce the `FAILURE_BUCKET_ID`,
  `IMAGE_NAME`, and call stack (e.g. `0x7a_c0000185_DUMP_VIOSTOR` -> viostor.sys,
  or `PAGE_HASH_ERRORS_0x1a_3f` for page-hash corruption).
  `collect-guest.ps1 -Symbolize` runs it inline.

All lookup tables (`bugcheck-codes.json`, `trigger-methods.json`,
`crash-control.json`, `event-sources.json`, `host-signals.json`) are the single
source of truth in [`../src/data/`](../src/data/); no table is duplicated inside
a script.
